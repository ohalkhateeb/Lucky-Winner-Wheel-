## Customization

### Changing Prize Amounts and Distribution
To change the prize amounts, their counts, or add new prize tiers, modify the `this.prizes` array and the `generateSegmentPrizes()` method in `js/prizes.js`.

**1. `this.prizes` array:**
This array defines the prize tiers, their initial counts, and visual properties. You can adjust the `amount`, `count`, `type`, and `icon` for each prize.
```javascript
// js/prizes.js
this.prizes = [
    { amount: 1000, count: 1, remaining: 1, type: 'gold', icon: 'fas fa-crown' },
    { amount: 500, count: 10, remaining: 10, type: 'silver', icon: 'fas fa-star' },
    { amount: 300, count: 12, remaining: 12, type: 'bronze', icon: 'fas fa-medal' }
];
```

**2. `generateSegmentPrizes()` method:**
This method populates the wheel segments with prizes based on the counts defined in `this.prizes`. If you change the `count` in `this.prizes`, you must also adjust the loops in this method accordingly to ensure the correct number of each prize is added to the wheel.
```javascript
// js/prizes.js
generateSegmentPrizes() {
    const segments = [];
    
    // Example: Add 1x 1000 AED prize
    segments.push({ amount: 1000, type: 'gold', icon: 'fas fa-crown' });
    
    // Example: Add 10x 500 AED prizes
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        segments.push({ amount: 500, type: 'silver', icon: 'fas fa-star' });
    }
    
    // Example: Add 12x 300 AED prizes
    for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
        segments.push({ amount: 300, type: 'bronze', icon: 'fas fa-medal' });
    }
    
    // Ensure the total number of prizes pushed here matches the total number of segments (employees)
    // The wheel currently has 23 segments, so ensure 23 prizes are pushed.
    
    // Shuffle the segments (important for random distribution)
    for (let i = segments.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [segments[i], segments[j]] = [segments[j], segments[i]];
    }
    
    return segments;
}
```

### Changing Number of Employees (Segments on Wheel)
To change the total number of employees (which corresponds to the number of segments on the wheel), you need to modify two places:

**1. `this.segments` property in `js/wheel.js`:**
This defines how many equal segments the wheel will be divided into.
```javascript
// js/wheel.js
this.segments = 23; // Change this number to your desired total number of employees/segments
```

**2. `PrizeManager` constructor and `getProgress()` method in `js/prizes.js`:**
- In the `PrizeManager` constructor, update the `availableSegments` initialization to match the new total number of segments.
- In the `getProgress()` method, update the total number of winners used for percentage calculation.
```javascript
// js/prizes.js
constructor() {
    // ... other properties
    this.availableSegments = new Set(Array.from({length: 23}, (_, i) => i)); // Update '23' to your new total
}

// ...

getProgress() {
    return Math.round((this.getTotalWinners() / 23) * 100); // Update '23' to your new total
}
```

**Important Note**: When changing the number of employees/segments, ensure that the total number of prizes defined in `js/prizes.js` (`generateSegmentPrizes()` method) exactly matches the new `this.segments` value in `js/wheel.js`.

### Customizing Colors
Modify the color scheme in `css/styles.css`:
```css
/* Example of colors you can change */
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0F172A 0%, #1E293B 50%, #334155 100%);
}

.title {
    color: #FFD700;
}

/* And other color properties throughout styles.css */
```
